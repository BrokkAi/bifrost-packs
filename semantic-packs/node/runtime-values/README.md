# Node runtime-values packs

`typescript/bifrost.node-runtime-values.json` and
`javascript/bifrost.node-runtime-values.json` carry the reviewed Node
runtime-values contract for the `keyed_read_value` capability. Each pack
publishes one enabled `process` global exposure for the Node v22.11.0
linux/x64 main-realm CommonJS profile, plus two keyed-read behaviors:
static-property reads of `process.env` and static-index reads of
`process.argv`. TSX workspaces use the TypeScript pack; the shared
TypeScript front end parses both dialects and the acceptance test proves
TSX positives and near misses independently.

## Layered contract

An exposure marked `enabled` is intrinsically eligible within its model;
it does not bypass pack activation. Every pack in this directory sets
`safety.review_required`, so the exposure stays inert until the host
supplies exact activation evidence (language, npm ecosystem, Node
artifact coordinates, profile configuration, and artifact digest) and an
explicit compatible `enable` control names the pack id. The activation
report retains that enable decision; the published endpoint rows retain
the exposure, behavior, and active-model-set identities.

A workspace states the Node artifact coordinates, profile configuration,
and artifact digest by declaring the reviewed revision: root
`package.json` `engines.node` or `volta.node`, `.nvmrc`, or
`.node-version` set to `22.11.0`. The workspace activation transaction
turns that declaration into the evidence rows above, so the pack selects
through the same contract the acceptance tests exercise. A declaration of
another revision, a range, or no declaration at all mints no evidence and
leaves the pack `incompatible`, with a reason naming the missing
coordinate and the digest and configuration the selector requires.

The packs carry no authored binding evidence or observations. Only
workspace-derived analyzer evidence can authoritatively describe lexical
bindings, rebinding exclusions, keyed loads, mutation state, and
observation identity in a particular workspace, so the production
evaluator joins the authored exposure and behavior records with the
workspace's own syntax and executable-semantic facts. Parameters, locals,
and imports that lexically bind `process` are conclusively excluded;
reassignment, dynamic keys and indices, unsupported runtimes and
profiles, and incomplete analysis stay typed incomplete.

## Digest recipes

All digests are SHA-256 over exact reviewed bytes. Nothing here uses a
placeholder.

- The runtime artifact digest is the SHA-256 of the official
  `node-v22.11.0.tar.gz` source distribution archive as listed in the
  distributor checksum file at
  `https://nodejs.org/dist/v22.11.0/SHASUMS256.txt`:
  `24e5130fa7bc1eaab218a0c9cb05e03168fa381bb9e3babddc6a11f655799222`.
  The digest pins the exact Node revision; the profile statement below
  selects the modeled execution environment.
- The behavior evidence digest is the SHA-256 of the reviewed
  `doc/api/process.md` document at the `v22.11.0` tag, byte-identical
  inside the archive and at
  `https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/v22.11.0/doc/api/process.md`:
  `978ccf50488c3378fb7dc8e89945f3db4e613627af6a8ed63c6da367a04e478a`.
  The reviewed sections state that `process.argv` is the materialized
  launch-argument array, that `process.env` is the user-environment
  object, that reads yield a value or `undefined`, and that both
  containers are writable, which grounds the nonthrowing, eager,
  value-or-undefined, and pristine-input-until-write claims.
- The runtime profile digest is the SHA-256 of the RFC 8785 canonical
  JSON of the exposure's authored `runtime` applicability record:
  `70db7f8c799decb554bc25e8bf410079c8b377f2852ee2a982d56db40f054056`.
  The acceptance test recomputes this digest from the checked-in pack
  with the production canonicalizer, so the recipe is pinned, not just
  documented.

## Coverage boundary

The profile models the main realm of one Node process launched without
preload customization on Linux x64 in CommonJS mode. Worker threads,
which receive a copy of the parent environment, other platforms and
architectures, other module modes, and other `process` members are
outside the reviewed contract and stay incomplete. The mutation proof
closes a single-file module for direct writes to the `process` root: a
write to that root anywhere in the module leaves every read typed
incomplete. Effect and accessor hazards are scoped to the read's own
execution context and ordered against it, so only a hazard that can run
before the read -- module linkage, an earlier statement in the same
function, or a hazard inside a loop that also contains the read -- leaves
it typed incomplete. The profile still assumes no preloads: unmodeled
module-load effects are outside the closed proof and are excluded by the
`closed-workspace-no-preloads` host assumption the profile carries. A
workspace whose module loading writes `process.env` or `process.argv`
(such as one that populates the environment from a dotenv file) does not
satisfy that assumption and must not select this profile.

Configuration documents cannot activate or intersect this domain: pack
selection requires exact code-runtime evidence rows, and the evaluator
only joins loads from JavaScript/TypeScript executable artifacts.

The complete upstream notice is retained in
`notices/node-v22.11.0.txt`.
